==================================

Singleton Design Pattern

The singleton pattern is a common pattern you'll run into when developing. 
It's also a useful introduction to a practical implementation of a design pattern.

The singleton design patterns describes how to do which of the following?
Create methods that are declared once
Create a class that's only ever instantiated once

=================================================

Observer Design Pattern

The observer design pattern is used to notify dependents of certain events, usually state changes in a subject.

two classes defined by observer patterns.

    -subject, wich maintains a list of observers and includes methods for attaching, detaching and notifying observers.

            login flow
            user interaction
            directs models and views


Match the MVC components to their function.

Stores data
Model
Presents data
views
Handles logic
Controller
