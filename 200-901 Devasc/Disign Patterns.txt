Understanding Design Patterns

Design patterns are templates developers use to approach coding challenges with a plan of execution.

Design patterns are coded in specific languages to solve problems. True or false?
True
False

==================================

Singleton Design Pattern

The singleton pattern is a common pattern you'll run into when developing. 
It's also a useful introduction to a practical implementation of a design pattern.

The singleton design patterns describes how to do which of the following?
Create methods that are declared once
Create a class that's only ever instantiated once

=================================================

Observer Design Pattern

The observer design pattern is used to notify dependents of certain events, usually state changes in a subject.

two classes defined by observer patterns.

    -subject, wich maintains a list of observers and includes methods for attaching, detaching and notifying observers.

    - observer wich has a method to recieve updates form subject

    een observer kan meerder subject connections hebben

Which of the following are components of an observer? (Choose three

Model View Controller

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software pattern that separates data, behavior, and presentation into isolated components.

is a high level abtration where responsiblities are divided up into three loosely coupled components


    -Model =
        the component that stores data
    -View
        the component that displays data
    -Controller
        the component that handles 
            login flow
            user interaction
            directs models and views


Match the MVC components to their function.

Stores data
Model
Presents data
views
Handles logic
Controller

Design Patterns Summary

Design patterns are important structures for writing reliable software solutions to known problems.

test solutions
framework for new code
clarify between developers

A design pattern can communicate the intent of code to someone reading it for the first time. True or false?
True

        if enemy_name in count:
            count[enemy_name] += 1
        else:
            count[enemy_name] = 1


    return count

    if not enemies_dict:
        return

    most_common_enemey = float('-inf')
    
    for enemy in enemies_dict:
        enemey_occurance = enemies_dict[enemy]


        if enemey_occurance > most_common_enemey:
            most_common_enemey =  enemey_occurance
            name = enemy
