Introduction

You're probably very excited to start writing some Python scripts or Ansible playbooks and dive into the expansive world of automation. 
It's hard not to be excited!
Despite that, you'll want to hold your horses for just a second (trust me, you'll get into the development fun sooner rather than later!). 
he best way to ensure that we are ready to begin developing is to prepare a working development environment, complete with all the tools we'll need. 
Just like how a homebuilder isn't going to begin building a foundation without their hammer, we need to make sure all our tools are ready!

step zero setup all your tools
=====================================================

While you're likely tempted to download all the development tools you'll need directly to your actual workstation, 
there is a better solution—running a dedicated Linux-based development environment that is separate from your actual workstation. 
This gives us the best of both worlds. We can develop on Linux and take advantage of its
developer-friendly architecture and rich package support without disrupting our regular OS (e.g., Windows).

We have two main options for deploying a Linux machine to run our development environment:

    Running Linux in a VM
    Running the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)

Let's talk about what we need to do to deploy Linux using either option!

Before we begin, make sure virtualization is enabled on your system! Consult your motherboard/system's documentation for more details.

1 wat OS 
2 wat os should we use
    linux easy 
    compatibility (dev env)

options for deploying linux
    single linux install
    dual but win/linux
    vm with linux
    WLS 2



Linux makes for a great development platform due to the abundance of development-centric packages. True or false?
True

Deploying Ubuntu Linux in a VM

Let's dive into deploying Ubuntu Desktop in a virtual machine using VMware Workstation!

1 downlaod ubuntu Desktop, server versie heeft geen GUI

vm-tools maak bv je resoltie in orde

What command did we use to install VMware Tools on the Ubuntu VM?
sudo apt install open-vm-tools

wat makkelijker is WSL
in admin terminal

wsl --install


PS C:\windows\system32> wsl --install
Installing: Virtual Machine Platform
Virtual Machine Platform has been installed.
Installing: Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows Subsystem for Linux has been installed.

reboot 
install daarna:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

daarna ansible 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install wget software-properties-common apt-transport-https
sudo apt install ansible -y

powershell 
sudo apt install powershell
sudo apt install wget software-properties-common apt-transport-https

docker 

en voor Vs Code de wsl extention
na installatie herstart en verder met installatie met app wsl
ubuntu wordt nu verder gedraaid

Ubuntu is al geïnstalleerd.
Ubuntu starten...
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
