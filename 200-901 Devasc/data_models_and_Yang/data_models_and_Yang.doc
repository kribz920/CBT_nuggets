Introducing Data Models and YANG

Before you can start coding, you need to understand the structure of the data being sent.

What is a Data Model?

What good is data if you can't interpret it? Network devices feel the same way. 
Let's introduce the concept of modeling data in this Nugget. 

how to send data


datamodel - datascheme
data model person:
    leaf height:
            datatype number
            description "height in com"
            max: 30
            min: 1

    leaf name:
            type string
            maxlentgh 100

{ person:
    height: 1,75
    name: chris samar
    }


Which of the following is another term for a "data model?"

schema!

How YANG Works

Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) is all about defining how a data model can be written and agreed upon. 
We'll introduce the structure of a YANG data model in this Nugget. 

before senden need to be agreed upon of what structure

                        name:"sdfs";
                        type: string;

                        enum "testing"

This Nugget is Important

Things may feel a bit fuzzy right now, but hang in there. There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

YANG tools make exploring a device's YANG models a breeze. True or false?
