Saying Goodbye to the CLI

We're in a new era for configuring our infrastructure, so let's introduce where this skill is going to take us. 

network automation term en what it is
 ==========================================================


 Why Network Automation?

Does network automation help us at all? 
Or is it just a different way to configure a network? 
This Nugget will bring to light why network automation is all the rage these days. 


efficiant to get things done


4 reasons

1 faster to get it done, makes us agile

2 standardization of work/configure

3 know outcomes know exactly what its doing
  make it scaleable

4 monitoring 

look as network as whole.

netdev ops

need to do learn all parts and peaces

Which of the following are the main benefits of network automation?
all above
=============================================================


What Can You Automate?

Network automation is just deploying configs quicker, right? Maybe not. This Nugget will cover WHAT you can automate.

1.  monitoring
    start with read only tasks to learn
    show config / snmp get to much data, more then you need.
    make easy to read script 

    lowest risk 

2.  device provisioning
    most of the time same basic config
    make a template with place holder {{device.hostname}} etc.
    JINJA template    YAML

3.  migrations
    make it easier 

4.  config management
        config devices

    desired state of our network
        is there a drift  form the desired state?
    make polices to check you script against internal policies

5.  troubleshooting
    check all ospf neighbours, all port errors if it happens make script the heal it self.
    to fix the issue.

If you want to reduce the risk of breaking something, which of the following should you automate first?
Network monitoring

The Evolution of Network APIs

We're going to introduce some major topics in this Nugget while also taking a stroll down memory lane.

human came before APIs with a console login 

machine communicatie via APIs, network device use network APIs

passed:
    snmp we used for monitoring and collect data, with an agent
    vendor specific, all or nothing no logic.
    not structured not very secure v3 no ecryption.

past/present: CLI   
    cli isnt dead
    can use telnet/ssh is like being on console.
    netconf is for network in 2006 
    IETF-2006
    YANG for structure
    to replace snmp, sends data in xml
    structured data
    uses port 22
    tcp
    uses RPC remote procedure calls
    REST API --- restconf

Which API protocol uses the SSH protocol as its transport layer?
NETCONF

Network Programmability vs. Network Automation

Programmability and automation are often confused, so let's clear up the meaning of these two terms.

Programmability is writing scripts met specifics taks to specific devices.
you could use just python for this 

automation is repeatable taks again large amout of devices or groups of devices.
desired state   
could make you network self healing


anisble is a tool for automation en orchistartion
automation = what needs to happe
orchistartion= when does it need to happen

writen in python
free/opensource/ agentless
Modules
    you make a playbook in YAML, make a module, pre build

When we talk about Ansible, which task are we referring to?
Network automation

Devices and Controllers in the Era of SDN

How we interact with devices and controllers matters. Learn about them in this Nugget.
