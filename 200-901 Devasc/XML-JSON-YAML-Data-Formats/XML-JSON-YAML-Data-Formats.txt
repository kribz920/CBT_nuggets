Why Use Plain Text Data Formats?

Plain text data formats are legible for both humans and computers and allow us to easily transmit data between disparate systems.

json xml yaml csv


structured for computers
annotated for humans
open and extensible
self-describing
platform agnostic / lifespan


human readable - computer readable

Which of the following are popular formats today? (Choose three)
YAML
JSON
XML

XML, JSON, and YAML Data Formats

The three data formats we'll be reviewing are XML, JSON, and YAML. 
They each have their own strengths and it's important as always to choose the right tool for the job.

XML extensible markup language
legacy support
SOAP webbased api 

verbose (longer and taller) extra bandwith/kost for trans port

JSON
javascript object notation

popular
lightweight
native to JS

YAML aint markup language
highly legible
compact/succint
ideal for configuration

XML has a lot of legacy support, but JSON is adopted more often by modern or newly-built systems. True or false?
True

====================================================================

XML Syntax

XML is a verbose and largely self-documenting data format based on the idea of tags, attributes, and values.

works with open and closing tags
<open attr=2>content</open>


How are attributes distinguished from values?
They're inside the XML tag brackets


attr <tag1 attr="bla">

<EmptyElement/>  is geldig een leeg gestoten tag 

-================================================================\

XML Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way of visualizing your XML document as a tree where each element represents a node. This Nugget discusses how to view the DOM for your XML.

==============================================================


JSON Syntax

Javascript Object Notation, or JSON, is a popular data format on the Internet because of its adherence to well-formed Javascript rules.

==============================================================

JSON Strings, Numbers, and Booleans

JSON recognizes different data types of the values it transmits, including strings (text), numbers, and booleans (true/false) types. 
net zoals python

JSON supports which of the following data types? (Choose three)

Strings
Booleans

Numbers
Correct!

============================================================== 

{object met "key": "value"}
[array]

Objects can be nested inside of other objects in JSON. True or false?
True
================================================================

YAML Syntax

YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) has unique structures to its syntax to support its primary goal: human-legible data serialization.

Which of the following is YAML's biggest differentiator from JSON and XML?
Human legibility

==================================================================

YAML Strings, Numbers, Floats, and Booleans

YAML supports a few basic data types for the values in its key-value pairs. Those types are strings, numbers (integers), floating point values, and booleans.

YAML makes no differentiation between an integer and a decimal numeric value. True or false?

False
