==============================================================

XML, JSON, and YAML Data Formats

The three data formats we'll be reviewing are XML, JSON, and YAML. 
They each have their own strengths and it's important as always to choose the right tool for the job.

XML extensible markup language
legacy support
SOAP webbased api 

verbose (longer and taller) extra bandwith/kost for trans port

JSON
javascript object notation

popular
lightweight
native to JS

YAML aint markup language
highly legible
compact/succint
ideal for configuration

XML has a lot of legacy support, but JSON is adopted more often by modern or newly-built systems. True or false?
True

====================================================================

XML Syntax

XML is a verbose and largely self-documenting data format based on the idea of tags, attributes, and values.

works with open and closing tags
<open attr=2>content</open>


How are attributes distinguished from values?
They're inside the XML tag brackets
